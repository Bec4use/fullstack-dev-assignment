# Hotel Booking System

This project is a comprehensive hotel booking system designed to streamline the process of online room booking. It provides a user-friendly interface where customers can view detailed information about available rooms, including room type, price, and amenities.

The system allows users to select their preferred check-in and check-out dates using an interactive calendar. It also offers an option to include breakfast with the booking. The total price, including any additional services, is calculated in real-time as the user makes their selections.

One of the key features of this system is its integration with Stripe, a leading online payment processing platform. This ensures that all transactions are secure and reliable. Users can make payments directly within the application, providing a seamless booking experience.

The application is built using Next.js, a popular React framework, and TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds reliability and maintainability to the codebase. The backend is powered by a RESTful API, ensuring efficient communication between the client and server.

This hotel booking system is perfect for hotel owners looking to digitize their booking process and enhance their customer service. It's also ideal for customers seeking a convenient and reliable platform to book their next hotel stay.
